<!--This script is based in a Win+R command I wrote with some
    team members while doing some team building/coding activities
    The only html element is the paragraph with id s. The rest of
    the code is javascript:
        - First of all you got the function d to set the style of the
        paragraph, as it can make it travel through the screen with
        the margin style element.
        - Secondly, you got the declaration of c as the counter of
        clicks (rats for this version)
        - Thirdly, there is t, the countdown of the seconds left.
        - Then you call to the d() function to start the game.
        - After that, in an interval of 999ms (shorter than 1000ms)
        it starts subtracting seconds to the variable t (while
        also disabling s.onclick when reaching 0)
        - Therefore, it goes with the declaration of function i with
        the parameter c, setting the innerText of the paragraph to
        track the variables in the game
        - And finally, the definition of the  onclick function for
         the paragraph, that calls to the function i with parameter
         ++c and also the call to d() to randomly place the paragraph
         s
    Hope you like it!
