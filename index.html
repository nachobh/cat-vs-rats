<!--This script is based in a Win+R command I wrote with some
    team members while doing some team building/coding activities:

    cmd /K echo "<p id=s><script>r=Math.random;d=__=>s.style=
    `width:3%;background:red;margin:${40*r()}%${60*r()}%`;c=0;
    t=30;d();setInterval(___=>{t--;i(c);t<0&&(s.onclick=0)},999);
    i=c=>s.innerText=c+`\n\n${t}s`;s.onclick=__=>i(++c)&d()</script>
    ">g.htm&start g.htm

    The only html element is the paragraph with id s. The rest of
    the code is javascript:
        - First of all, there is the declaration of r as Math.random.
        - Secondly, you got the function d to set the style of the
        paragraph, as it can make it travel through the screen with
        just this margin style element and its definition by %.
        - Thirdly, you got the declaration of c as the counter of
        clicks (rats for this version)
        - Later, there is t, the countdown of the seconds left.
        - Then you call to the d() function to start the game.
        - After that, in an interval of 999ms (shorter than 1000ms)
        it starts subtracting seconds to the variable t (while
        also disabling s.onclick when reaching 0)
        - Therefore, it goes with the declaration of function i with
        the parameter c, setting the innerText of the paragraph to
        track the variables in the game
        - And finally, the definition of the  onclick function for
         the paragraph, that calls to the function i with parameter
         ++c and also the call to d() (using &) to randomly place the
         paragraph s


    Game mechanics:
        - A rectangle (3% width) appears randomly on screen
        - Click it to catch a rat and increase your score
        - After each click, the rectangle moves to a new random
        position and also your score is increased
        - You have 30 seconds to catch as many rats as possible

    Hope you like it!
